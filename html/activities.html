		<h3>Rains To Pick Up Pace Over Odisha And Andhra Pradesh</h3>
                <p> Odisha has been receiving good rainfall since last many days. At present rainfall of Odisha is normal. During the second half of July, a Low-Pressure area developed over Odisha coast which gave moderate to heavy showers leading flooding in many districts.</br></br>
                 Light scattered rains are expected to continue for another two days. Thereafter rains are expected to increase over remaining parts. The reason for the increase can be attributed to the formation of a cyclonic circulation over North coast of Odisha which will gradually move inland and will give light to moderate rains over many parts of Odisha for at least three to four day. Good rains are possible in between August 6 to 9 over Bhubaneshwar, Puri, Sambalpur, Cuttack, and Paradip.

	<h3>After 2 Consecutive Days Of Rains, Chennai Now Bracing For Dry Spell</h3>
          <p>Chennai has been recording Monsoon rains for the last two consecutive days. Nungambakkam Observatory in the city recorded 15 mm of rains in span of 24 hours from 8:30 am on Wednesday, while Minambakkam Observatory saw 8 mm of rain.</br></br>
          August has started on the rainy note for the state capital, with these showers bringing some respite from humid weather during the evening hours. However, afternoon continues to be hot and sultry as these rains generally occur during the evening hours.</br></br>
          Since rains are during the latter part of the day, they do not have much impact on the maximum temperatures and they continue to settle around 37 C.</br></br>
          However, Chennai is now gearing up for dry days ahead. According to weathermen, a feeble trough running along the Tamil Nadu coast and a cyclonic circulation over South Andhra Pradesh were responsible for these showers.</br></br>
